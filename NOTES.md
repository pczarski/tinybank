#### I decided to keep everything in a single domain instead of Users and Accounts domain because I assumed that each user can have one account; and thus, username is reused as account identifier.

#### If a user could have multiple accounts, and Account object would decouple transactions from users, making it possible for Users to be it's own domain.
